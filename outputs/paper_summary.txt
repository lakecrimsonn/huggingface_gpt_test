The paper "Attention is All You Need" introduces a new network architecture called the transformer, which relies solely on attention mechanisms instead of complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks. The transformer model outperforms existing models in machine translation tasks, achieving higher quality translations, being more parallelizable, and requiring significantly less training time. The paper presents results from experiments showing improvements in translation quality and efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score for English-to-French translation. The work involved collaboration from multiple researchers from Google Brain, Google Research, and the University of Toronto.
The passage discusses traditional recurrent models which process input and output sequences sequentially, limiting parallelization. Recent work has made improvements in efficiency using factorization tricks and conditional computation. Attention mechanisms have been effective in capturing dependencies across sequences, typically in conjunction with recurrent networks. The transformer model is introduced as an architecture that relies solely on attention mechanisms for global dependencies, allowing for increased parallelization and achieving state-of-the-art results in translation quality. The model architecture includes stacked self-attention and fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder. The encoder consists of multiple identical layers, each containing self-attention mechanisms and position-wise fully connected layers. The transformer model represents a departure from traditional recurrent and convolutional approaches by using self-attention exclusively for capturing dependencies.
The model architecture described is a transformer that utilizes fully connected feed-forward networks with residual connections and layer normalization. Each sub-layer in the model, including the embedding layers, outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. The decoder consists of a stack of n=6 identical layers, with an additional sub-layer for multi-head attention over the encoder stack output. Attention is defined as a function that maps a query and key-value pairs to an output. The scaled dot-product attention is a specific type of attention mechanism used in this model. It calculates dot products of queries and keys, and computes weighted sums of values based on the compatibility between the query and key.
Scaled dot-product attention is a mechanism used in multi-head attention, where multiple attention layers run in parallel. The process involves computing the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, with keys and values also packed together in matrices. The attention mechanism consists of softmax function applied to the scaled dot products of queries and keys, resulting in output values. The approach of scaling the dot products helps prevent the softmax function from encountering extremely small gradients for large values of dk.

In multi-head attention, queries, keys, and values are linearly projected multiple times with different learned linear projections to different dimensionalities before performing the attention function in parallel on each projected version. The outputs are then concatenated, projected again, and combined to produce the final output values. This approach allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions, enhancing its ability to process complex data.
The text describes a multi-head attention mechanism used in a model with 8 parallel attention heads. Each head projects the queries, keys, and values using parameter matrices, resulting in reduced dimensions. This multi-head attention is applied in encoder-decoder attention layers, self-attention layers in the encoder and decoder, and position-wise feed-forward networks. The model also employs embeddings, softmax functions, and positional encodings to handle sequences without recurrence or convolution.
The text discusses different layer types used in neural network architectures, namely self-attention, recurrent, and convolutional layers. It evaluates them based on factors such as computational complexity, parallelizability, and maximum path lengths for handling long-range dependencies. Self-attention layers are highlighted for their ability to connect all positions with a constant number of operations, making them faster than recurrent layers for smaller sequence lengths compared to the representation dimension. The text also mentions positional encodings using sine and cosine functions to help the model learn to attend by relative positions and discusses the choice of using self-attention layers over recurrent and convolutional layers for sequence transduction tasks.
The text discusses the use of convolutional layers in neural networks, particularly in the context of increasing the maximum path length for better connectivity between input and output positions. It also mentions the use of separable convolutions to decrease complexity, compares them to other layers like self-attention, and discusses the interpretability of models using self-attention. Additionally, it provides details on the training regime for models, including data, batching, hardware, schedule, optimizer usage, and regularization techniques.
The table shows that the transformer model achieves better BLEU scores compared to previous state-of-the-art models on English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost. The big transformer model outperforms the best previously reported models by more than 2.0 BLEU on the English-to-German task and achieves a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. Additionally, on the English-to-French task, the big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, surpassing all previously published single models at a lower training cost. Label smoothing during training was employed to improve accuracy and BLEU scores. The results demonstrate the superior performance of transformer models in machine translation tasks.
The table shows variations on the transformer architecture with different parameters and their impact on performance metrics in English-to-German translation. The study explores changes in model dimensions, key size, dropout rates, and positional encoding methods. It concludes that smaller attention key sizes hurt model quality, larger models perform better, and dropout is effective in preventing overfitting. Replacing sinusoidal positional encoding with learned embeddings yields similar results to the base model. The transformer model based on attention outperforms architectures with recurrent or convolutional layers in translation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on various datasets. Future work aims to apply attention-based models to different tasks beyond text, explore efficient attention mechanisms for larger inputs like images and audio, and improve non-sequential generation. The code used for training the models is available on GitHub.
